N100_cost400 - 100N of force every 5 seconds. 80 iterations for lambda = 13
N200_cost1300 - 200N of force every 5 seconds. There was instances that worked and if we ran the optimization function for a bit longer, we will definitely have had a result that worked. Took about 330 generations using 13 for the value of lambda. 

Let's try 200,300,400




Also let's try to randomize the timestep which we push and see how much force we can take


Also let's try different number of lambda -> currently we are doing 13, we have 21 dimensional data, I think about 50 sounds better.

N200_cost1300 - 360 generations (ran for about 7 hours) 100=lambda. Doesn't bring much difference from having 13=lambda
